# Abstract

The **ch.paf.link application profile** is the Swiss-specific implementation of the [paf.link schema](https://paf.link) for different public affairs.

It defines very specific RDF ([[[rdf11-concepts]]]) classes and properties as subclasses of the elements of **paf.link** and [[[prov-o]]].
