# Introduction

The main target group of this repository are people implementing software. For a deeper understanding of the ideas and basic principles behind the paf.link schema, please refer to the [paf.link documentation](https://paf.link).

## Basic Elements

There are three basic elements in ch.paf.link that are used to describe public affairs:

- **activities**: what is done and when
- **agents**: who is doing it
- **entities**: what is used as input for activities and what is produced by them as output

## Third Layer

ch.paf.link is the [third layer](https://paf.link/#layered-design) of the paf.link schema.
